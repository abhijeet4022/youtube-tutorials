### User Management:

* Create, modify, and delete user accounts and groups.
* Manage permissions and ownership of files and directories.

### Patching and Updates:

* Apply security patches and system updates.
* Test updates in staging environments before deployment.

---

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Log Management:

* Analyze logs using tools like journalctl, syslog, or ELK Stack to troubleshoot issues.
* Investigate system crashes, service failures, or security breaches.

### Service Management:

* Start, stop, restart, and monitor services using systemctl or equivalent tools.
* Troubleshoot issues with web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or application servers.

### Incident Response:

* Respond to and resolve issues reported by users or monitoring systems.
* Escalate critical issues as needed.

## Security Management

### Access Control:

* Implement and audit file permissions, SELinux, or AppArmor policies.
* Manage SSH keys and access for users and applications.

### Security Hardening:

* Configure firewalls (e.g., iptables, firewalld) and intrusion detection systems.
* Perform vulnerability scans and address findings.

### Backup and Recovery:

* Set up and verify system backups using tools like rsync, tar, or backup software.
* Test and document disaster recovery procedures.

## Automation and Scripting

### Task Automation:

* Write and maintain shell scripts or use tools like Ansible for repetitive tasks.
* Automate system monitoring, backups, and user provisioning.

### Cron Jobs:

* Schedule and manage cron jobs for recurring tasks.
* Review and debug issues related to scheduled jobs.

## Server and Application Management

### Deployment and Configuration:

* Deploy and configure applications or middleware.
* Manage configuration files and version control.

### Database Management:

* Perform basic database administration tasks (e.g., backups, tuning).

### Virtualization and Cloud:

* Manage virtual machines or containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
* Work with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) to provision and manage Linux servers.

---

## Documentation and Reporting

### Document Procedures:

* Maintain documentation for system configurations, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and troubleshooting guides.

### Reporting:

* Generate and review system health reports.
* Share insights with teams or management about server uptime, resource usage, or security incidents.

---

## Collaboration and Communication

### Team Coordination:

* Collaborate with application, network, and DevOps teams to ensure seamless operations.
* Participate in planning meetings for new projects or infrastructure changes.

### Training and Mentoring:

* Train junior team members or colleagues on Linux best practices and tools.
