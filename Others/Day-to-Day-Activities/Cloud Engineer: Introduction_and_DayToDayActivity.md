# Tell Me About Yourself

My name is "Your Name", and I am a Science graduate from the class of 2024, with nearly "Experienc in years" years of experience as a Cloud Support Associate at "Your Company Name" â€” including 1 year as an intern and the remainder as a full-time employee. I specialize in AWS and Linux, focusing on managing cloud infrastructure and Linux servers. My role involves extensive hands-on work with Linux operating systems and AWS services, where I handle system administration, incident management, troubleshooting, and performance optimization. I also manage changes and service requests to ensure high availability and stability of cloud environments.

> Note: If you did not attend any internship, you can skip the internship part and mention your full-time experience only.

# Day-to-Day Activity

- My typical day begins by reviewing automated reports generated overnight, which include insights related to cost optimization, non-compliant resources, and unused assets within the AWS environment. If any non-compliant or unused resources are identified, We proactively reach out to the respective developers or resource owners to confirm whether those resources are still required or can be decommissioned.

- Following this, We also focus on monitoring the infrastructure to ensure stable and smooth operations by using monitoring tool called Grafana.

- As part of system maintenance, We manage patching activities for both Linux and Windows servers, ensuring compliance and security updates are regularly applied.

- We also involved in VM lifecycle management, including:
  * Provisioning new virtual machines based on team/project requirements
  * Decommissioning unused or legacy systems after validation

- Throughout the day, We work on incident, service request (SR), and change management using ServiceNow (SNOW), following the ITIL framework. Tasks often include like:

  * Troubleshooting CPU and disk utilization issues
  * Investigating application performance degradation
  * Resolving user access-related incidents

- Finally, my day usually ends with a standup meeting, where we discuss backlog tasks, current progress, and any blockers that need to be addressed. That is pretty much my day-to-day activity.
