# Tell Me About Yourself

My name is "Your Name", and I am a "Science Graduate" from the class of "2024", with nearly "Experience in years" years of experience as a "Cloud Support Associate" at "Your Company Name" — including 1 year as an intern and the remainder as a full-time employee. I specialize in AWS and Linux, focusing on managing cloud infrastructure and Linux servers. My role involves extensive hands-on work with Linux operating systems and AWS services, where I handle system administration, incident management, troubleshooting, and performance optimization. I also manage changes and service requests to ensure high availability and stability of cloud environments.

> Note: If you did not attend any internship, you can skip the internship part and mention your full-time experience only.

# Day-to-Day Activity

- My typical day begins by reviewing automated reports generated overnight, which include insights related to cost optimization, non-compliant resources, and unused assets within the AWS environment. If any non-compliant or unused resources are identified, We proactively reach out to the respective developers or resource owners to confirm whether those resources are still required or can be decommissioned.

- Following this, We also focus on monitoring the infrastructure to ensure stable and smooth operations by using monitoring tool called Grafana.

- As part of system maintenance, We manage patching activities for both Linux and Windows servers, ensuring compliance and security updates are regularly applied.

- We also involved in VM lifecycle management, including:
  * Provisioning new virtual machines based on team/project requirements
  * Decommissioning the unused servers after proper validation and approval

- Throughout the day, We work on incident, service request (SR), and change management using ServiceNow (SNOW), following the ITIL framework. Tasks often include like:

  * Troubleshooting CPU, Memory and disk utilization issues.
  * Investigating application performance degradation issues.
  * Resolving user created incidents

- Finally, my day usually ends with a standup meeting, where we discuss backlog tasks, current progress, and any blockers that need to be addressed. That is pretty much my day-to-day activity.

Q1. Tell me about yourself V-1?

I’m Abhijeet Pramanik, a Computer Science graduate with 3.6 years of total IT experience, including 3 years as a DevOps Engineer. I specialize in AWS and Azure, where I manage cloud infrastructure, automate tasks, and deploy applications. I use tools like Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and implement CI/CD pipelines to streamline application deployment. In addition, I work extensively with Linux OS, handling system administration tasks, troubleshooting, and ensuring smooth operations. I also manage incidents, changes, and service requests to maintain the stability of cloud environments.
Q2. What is your day-to-day activity V-1?

Day-to-Day Activities:

Monitoring Infrastructure: We are using Grafana and ELK to track system performance, health, and logs, ensuring the infrastructure runs smoothly.
SNOW Management: Actively manage and resolve tickets, ensuring issues are tracked and resolved in a timely manner.
CI/CD Pipeline Management: We set up and maintain CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, check for failed pipeline jobs, resolve issues, and rerun the jobs as needed, addressing any blockers that may arise.
Docker Management: Working with the Dev Team to write Dockerfiles, configuring Jenkins jobs to use docker build, tag, etc.
Pod Management: We monitor the Pods using Grafana and identify and resolve issues to ensure seamless application performance.
Infrastructure as Code: I have worked with Terraform to create AWS components like EC2, IAM, VPC, ELB, Security Groups, S3, etc.
IAM Management: Handle user access requests and manage IAM roles/policies for secure access to AWS resources as per the requirement.
Automation: Automate routine tasks with shell scripts and enhance workflows using tools like Ansible for configuration management.
Cost Optimization: Monitor daily cost reports, identify stale or unused resources, and tag relevant stakeholders for action on resource optimization.
Meetings and Collaboration: Participate in daily Ops-Calls, client meetings, and internal team discussions to align on progress and priorities.
Documentation: Maintain clear and effective infrastructure documentation on Confluence for knowledge sharing and process improvements.
Q1. Tell me about yourself V-2?

Myself Abhijeet Pramanik, I’m a Computer Science graduate 2019 pass-out. I have total 3.6 years of IT experience, and I’ve been working as a DevOps Engineer for the past three years.
I started my career in supporting on-prem data centers where I have worked with Dell and HP servers and then moved into a Cloud and DevOps role.
Currently, I’m working at Blazeclan Technologies, which was acquired by ITC Infotech.
I’ve worked with clients from the USA, Singapore, and the UK, who are mainly in retail, hospitality, and property businesses.
Q2. What is your day-to-day activity V-2?

Day-to-Day Activities:

In my day-to-day activity, my day generally starts with reviewing the reports generated overnight, which could be related to cost, non-compliance, or unused resources currently present in the cloud environment. If I find any unused or non-compliant resources, I reach out to the respective developers or resource owners to confirm whether those resources are still required.
After that, we focus on monitoring the environment using tools like Grafana and ELK to ensure smooth operations. We use Prometheus and Grafana for resource utilization monitoring, while ELK helps in log analysis to detect any potential issues.
Another important task is monitoring Jenkins pipelines, checking if they have run successfully, ensuring all stages are completed, and troubleshooting any failures due to missing dependencies or other errors.
Since our applications are deployed on EKS, we also manage and troubleshoot Kubernetes pods as per requirements.
During deployments, we document any issues faced before and after the release so that we can improve the deployment process for the next cycle.
Apart from this, we also handle Incident, Service Request (SR), and Change Management by working on tickets in ServiceNow (SNOW) and bug tracking in JIRA by following the ITIL process.
Finally, my day usually ends with a standup meeting, where we discuss backlog tasks, current progress, and any blockers that need to be addressed. That is pretty much my day-to-day activity.
